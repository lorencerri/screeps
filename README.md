### Screeps

My personal AI that I'm developing for the Screeps: World game.

---

**TODO**

- [ ] Build containers next to sources
- [ ] Have couriers run materials from containers to spawn
- [ ] Use Grunt to allow me to make folders and better organize code
- [ ] Only allow max amount of creeps to go to source based on available spots
- [x] Creeps should have their own part templates
- [ ] Haul relative to spawn, not creep
- [ ] Have idle creeps move to a flag
- [ ] Implement a priority queue for building types (extensions -> containers -> roads)
- [ ] Implement a road building & repair queue
- [ ] Automatically place road building orders on frequently traveled paths (possibly by couriers only while not on expeditions)
- [ ] Implement scout class

**Known Issues**

- [] Multiple creeps will go towards the same source, despite only one mining spot being available
